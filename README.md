# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem Statement

X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces challenges in improving its lead conversion rate. While the company generates many leads daily through websites, search engines, and referrals, only about 30% of these leads convert into paying customers.

The company seeks to improve this conversion rate by identifying and prioritizing high-potential leadsâ€”referred to as 'Hot Leads'. By focusing the sales team's efforts on these leads, X Education aims to achieve a target lead conversion rate of approximately 80%.

A typical lead conversion process can be visualized as a funnel:

- The initial stage has many leads entering the pipeline.
- In the middle stage, potential leads need nurturing through communication, product education, and engagement.
- The final stage converts the most promising leads into paying customers.

To streamline this process, the company requires a predictive model that assigns a Lead Score to each lead, indicating their likelihood of conversion. Higher scores will enable the sales team to focus their efforts more efficiently.

## Data Description

The dataset provided by X Education contains 9,000+ data points with several attributes, including:
- Lead Source
- Total Time Spent on Website
- Total Visits  
- Last Activity

The target variable is 'Converted', where:

- 1 indicates the lead converted into a customer.
- 0 indicates the lead did not convert.

### Data Challenges

1. ome categorical variables include a level called 'Select', which is equivalent to missing or null data and must be addressed during preprocessing.

2. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables, requiring appropriate feature engineering and encoding techniques.

## Goals of the Case Study

1. Build a Logistic Regression Model:
   
    - Assign a lead score (between 0 and 100) to each lead.
    - High scores indicate leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.
    - Low scores indicate leads less likely to convert.
      
3. Adaptability:
   
    - Ensure the model can handle future company requirements or variations in lead characteristics.
     
5. Documentation and Presentation:
   
    - Deliver a well-commented Jupyter Notebook that includes the model, predictions, and evaluation metrics.
    - Prepare a document answering problem-specific questions.
    - Summarize the analysis in a 500-word brief report detailing the approach and key learnings.
    - Create a presentation outlining:
          - Problem statement
          - Analysis approach
          - Results in business terms
          - Visualizations and summaries of key findings.
         
## Analysis Approach

1. Data Preparation:
   
    - Handle null values, outliers, and redundant levels such as 'Select'.
    - Encode categorical variables appropriately.
    - Standardize and scale numerical variables.
      
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
    - Identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the data.
    - Use visualizations to understand relationships between variables.
      
3. Model Building:
   
    - Develop a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
      
4. Results Interpretation:
   
    - Analyze the coefficients to identify the most influential features.
    - Recommend strategies for improving lead conversion based on model insights.
      
5. Documentation:
    
    - Summarize key insights, learning, and recommendations in a brief report and a presentation.
  
## Key Results and Insights

1. Top Contributing Variables:
   
    - Features such as Welingak Websites, Reference, and Occupation: Working Professional significantly influence lead conversion probabilities.

3. Categorical Variables to Focus On:
   
    - Occupation: Working Professional
    - Lead Source: Reference
    - Last Activity: Other Activity
      
5. Model Performance:
   
    - The logistic regression model successfully predicts lead conversion with a high level of accuracy and interpretability.
      
4.Business Implications:

    - By focusing on high-scoring leads, the sales team can prioritize communication efforts, improving the conversion rate and reducing operational inefficiencies.
